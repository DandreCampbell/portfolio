                        Hey, my name is D’Andre. I’m a self taught, aspiring Front End Developer based out of New York. I choose this area of development because it allows me to combine my creative side with my love for coding. Currently, I’m working in the IT field as a Technician but I’ve always had an interest in the Development field. I have 4 years of programming in various different languages but currently React.js is my main focus.
